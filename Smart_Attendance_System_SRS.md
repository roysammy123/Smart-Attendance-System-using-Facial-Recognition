## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the software requirements for the Smart Attendance System using Facial Recognition. It outlines the system's features, functional and non-functional requirements, interfaces, constraints, and validation methods.

### 1.2 Scope
The Smart Attendance System will automate the attendance management process using facial recognition technology. It will allow users to authenticate, enroll new faces, capture attendance, and generate reports. The system will be designed to ensure accurate attendance records while maintaining data security and user privacy.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- SRS: Software Requirements Specification
- API: Application Programming Interface

### 1.4 References
- IEEE 830-1998 Standard for SRS
- [List any other references]

### 1.5 Overview
The following sections provide an in-depth understanding of the Smart Attendance System's requirements, features, interfaces, constraints, and validation procedures.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Smart Attendance System is a standalone software application that interfaces with compatible hardware components, including cameras and computing devices. It is not dependent on any other systems.

### 2.2 Product Features
The system will offer the following key features:
- User authentication through facial recognition
- Enroll new faces for recognition
- Capture attendance using facial recognition
- Generate attendance reports

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
The system is designed for two main user classes: administrators and attendees. Administrators manage the system, while attendees use it for attendance-related tasks.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
The system will operate on Windows and Linux operating systems and requires a compatible camera for facial recognition.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- The system must adhere to local data protection regulations.
- The facial recognition algorithm should provide high accuracy.
- The system should be user-friendly and intuitive.

### 2.6 User Documentation
The system will include user manuals and online help documentation to assist users in understanding its functionality and usage.

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
- The system assumes a stable network connection for communication.
- Dependency: Availability of a compatible camera for facial capture.

## 3. System Features and Requirements

### 3.1 Feature 1: User Authentication

#### 3.1.1 Description
This feature enables users to authenticate themselves using facial recognition before accessing the system.

#### 3.1.2 User Requirements
- Users should be able to log in securely using their facial features.

#### 3.1.3 Functional Requirements
- The system should capture the user's face during login.
- The captured face should be matched against the enrolled faces.
- Successful authentication grants access to the system.

#### 3.1.4 Non-Functional Requirements
- The authentication process should take no longer than 3 seconds.
- The false acceptance rate should be less than 1%.
