## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Smart Attendance System is a standalone software application that interfaces with compatible hardware components, including cameras and computing devices. It is not dependent on any other systems.

### 2.2 Product Features
The system will offer the following key features:
- User authentication through facial recognition
- Enroll new faces for recognition
- Capture attendance using facial recognition
- Generate attendance reports

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
The system is designed for two main user classes: administrators and attendees. Administrators manage the system, while attendees use it for attendance-related tasks.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
The system will operate on Windows and Linux operating systems and requires a compatible camera for facial recognition.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- The system must adhere to local data protection regulations.
- The facial recognition algorithm should provide high accuracy.
- The system should be user-friendly and intuitive.

### 2.6 User Documentation
The system will include user manuals and online help documentation to assist users in understanding its functionality and usage.

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
- The system assumes a stable network connection for communication.
- Dependency: Availability of a compatible camera for facial capture.

## 3. System Features and Requirements

### 3.1 Feature 1: User Authentication

#### 3.1.1 Description
This feature enables users to authenticate themselves using facial recognition before accessing the system.

#### 3.1.2 User Requirements
- Users should be able to log in securely using their facial features.

#### 3.1.3 Functional Requirements
- The system should capture the user's face during login.
- The captured face should be matched against the enrolled faces.
- Successful authentication grants access to the system.

#### 3.1.4 Non-Functional Requirements
- The authentication process should take no longer than 3 seconds.
- The false acceptance rate should be less than 1%.


### 3.2 Feature 2: Enroll New Faces

#### 3.2.1 Description
This feature allows administrators to enroll new faces into the system for recognition.

#### 3.2.2 User Requirements
- Administrators should be able to add new faces to the system.

#### 3.2.3 Functional Requirements
- Administrators should input user information and capture the user's face.
- The captured face should be stored securely in the system's database.

#### 3.2.4 Non-Functional Requirements
- Enrolling a new face should take no longer than 5 minutes.
- The system should support a minimum of 1000 enrolled faces.

### 3.3 Feature 3: Capture Attendance

#### 3.3.1 Description
This feature enables the system to capture attendance using facial recognition.

#### 3.3.2 User Requirements
- Attendees should be able to mark their attendance using their face.

#### 3.3.3 Functional Requirements
- The system should capture the attendee's face during attendance marking.
- The captured face should be matched against enrolled faces to mark attendance.

#### 3.3.4 Non-Functional Requirements
- The attendance marking process should take no longer than 2 seconds.
- The system should handle at least 50 attendees marking attendance simultaneously.

### 3.4 Feature 4: Generate Reports

#### 3.4.1 Description
This feature allows administrators to generate attendance reports.

#### 3.4.2 User Requirements
- Administrators should be able to obtain attendance reports for specific timeframes.

#### 3.4.3 Functional Requirements
- The system should provide an option to select a date range for the report.
- The system should generate a report displaying attendees' names and attendance status.

#### 3.4.4 Non-Functional Requirements
- Report generation should take no longer than 10 seconds.
- The generated reports should be available in PDF and CSV formats.

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces
- A login screen for user authentication
- An admin panel for enrolling faces and generating reports
- An attendance marking interface for attendees

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces
- USB camera for facial recognition
- Compatible computing devices (PCs, laptops)

### 4.3 Software Interfaces
- Operating systems: Windows 10, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Database system for storing enrolled faces

### 4.4 Communication Interfaces
- Internet connectivity for system updates and syncing data
